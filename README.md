# Introduction
In this analysis, we use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, we create a set of visualizations to:
•	Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
•	Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
•	Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, for final presentation we add these new visualizations and any two visualizations that we created in this module to create a story.
